# SwipableView
A Xamarin.Forms view providing swipe actions on Android, iOS and UWP: swipe left or right to display the contents of the lower panels.

Firstly, I forked from [Jonathan ANTOINE swipes action](https://github.com/jonathanantoine/XamarinFormSwipeActionWrapper) but I finally recoded it from scratch. I kept the Android renderer to avoid interference between the ScrollView and the PanGesture.
